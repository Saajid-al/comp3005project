# comp3005project

In this project, I tried my best to get the implementation done, however i didn't have enough time to get every implementation done. I really tried my best to get as much done as possible, I added my queries and all my inserts, and shown examples of what would happen with users interaction. There is a note however, I had to change order to bookOrder because order was a reserved word in SQL and I didn't have enough time to change it in all my diagrams. However I got the search option working for the project, where users can search using the ISBN, Author name, Book name, and Genre. Just run the lookinabook.py file,

where a user can enter any option and they can get the book returned back to them. I really tried my best to get this all done, and I had included comments with my inserts, and shown the relations/references between tables.
